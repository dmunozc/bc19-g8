max 1000 rounds
between 32x32 and 64x64 square maps
top left is 0,0
start with 1 to 3 castles, 100 karb and 500 fuel
resource tiles can be either karb or fuel
each round we receive 25 fuel
robots have full map knowledge, including resources, can only see robots withing their vision radius
each unit has its own process, 100mssec clock, with 20ms additional computation for each round. capped at 200 msec
if health drops to 0, unit is destroyed
units need to deposit mined stuff into castles or churches

castles:
health = 200
radius = 100
castles is a superset of churches
cannot be built
can attack, but consumes fuel
can trade with enemies, but only if accepted by enemy
can communicate with all units, one way (castle to units)
if all castles are destroyed, its game over
Units also have a direct channel to communicate an 8 bit value to all their teamâ€™s Castles for free from any distance. This can also be combined with any other action, including general radio communications.

friendly fire is active for AOE

churches:
produce robots for resources, at an adjacent point at end of turn
robots deposit resources when they are adjacent
cost 50 karb and 200 fuel to build
health = 100
radius = 100

pilgrims:
scouting, mining, building
cost: 10 karb, 50 fuel
most vision
non combatant
only miners of resources
each turn receives 2 karb or 10 fuel units mined
only unit that can construct buildings


crusader:
cost: 15 karb, 50 fuel
fastest

prophet:
cost: 25 karb, 50 fuel
most attack range
most attack cost
cannot attack close

preacher:
cost: 30 karb, 50 fuel
most expensive movement
most health
most attack + radius

each unit can only perform 1 action per turn

units that destroy other units receive half of resources require to build it + carrying resources
 all divided by the r^2 between the attacker and the target. So, if a Pilgrim were destroyed by a Crusader with dx,dy=(1,1) and was carrying 10 Fuel and 3 Karbonite, the attacker would now have an additional 5 Fuel and 4 Karbonite.
 
Radio is the primary method of communication usable by unit. In any given turn, a unit can broadcast a 16 bit message to all units within squared radius X^2, consuming X Fuel. For example, a unit with id 1984 that wanted to broadcast a message with a squared radius of 10 squares would need to expend Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(10)) = 4 Fuel. On the next round, all units within that radius will see that the a unit with ID 1984 broadcasted the given message (from its new position, if the unit moved). Units can radio broadcast simultaneously with all other actions. Note that robots can see the unit ID and x,y location that produced a broadcast, but not which team the unit belongs to.
